                I love <strong>photography</strong> ever since I was in college, I took one photography class and I felt in love with it. I started small with a compact camera and then I wanted to take photos to another profesional level so I bought a <em>DSRL</em> camera and I started traveling also, taking landscape pictures has been the one passion that I love the most, I love conecting myself with nature and outdoors. I been in this photography path for <strong>10 years </strong> or so, I'm ready for another challenge on my carrer and that is why I picked web developer because I can still travelling and taking beautiful photos while a I work at the same time. I find coding <em>fascinating</em> because I feel I can bring my and other people's ideas to life, it's also a great way for me to share my artistic side.  I love the concept that with coding, you can create something and be able to share it with everyone and potentially improve the lives of others with the push of a button.
